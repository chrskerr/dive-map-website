- LeafletJs
- Threejs

I've recently started travelling Australia and taking a more active interest in freediving, and realised that it's incredibly hard to work out if there are interesting dives nearby. Outside of talking to dive-shops, there doesn't appear to be a way of looking at a map and deciding where to visit based upon what it has.

So I started creating a simple React app which is intended to be the community hub for this information. Dives are addable, and editable, with an intended-Wikipedia style history to view changes and how they have evolved. I was this information to both belong to and be available to the community.

It is using Leafletjs for the mapping, and I am building an augmented reality dive site viewer using Threejs (very beta right now).

This is a new project under very active development, so is still considered beta :)
